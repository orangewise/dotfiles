#==> Caveats
#Please note that upstream has asked us to make explicit managing
#nvm via Homebrew is unsupported by them and you should check any
#problems against the standard nvm install method prior to reporting.

#You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:

#  mkdir ~/.nvm

#Add the following to ~/.bash_profile or your desired shell
#configuration file:

#  export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
#  source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

#You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
#/usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.29.0 will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
#upon upgrade/reinstall.

#Type `nvm help` for further information.

export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
